# QMCSoftware Website Prototype Plan

## Purpose and architecture

This repository will provide the single public-facing website for the
QMCSoftware organization. Quarto source lives on `main`, renders to `_site/`,
and is published by GitHub Actions to the `gh-pages` branch. The canonical
custom domain is `qmcsoftware.org`.

Technical documentation remains with each software repository and is linked
from this site. The website adds a shared public entry point; it does not
replace project documentation.

## Guiding principles

- Keep the prototype small, navigable, and easy to maintain.
- Reuse proven structural and deployment ideas without importing course or
  slide architecture.
- Treat maintained project sources as authoritative and avoid speculative copy.
- Separate source from generated output and validate each phase before adding
  complexity.
- Make later content migration explicit and reviewable.

## Phased roadmap

### Phase 0 — Confirm direction and inspect references

- [x] Confirm the repository roles, source branch, output directory, publish
  branch, custom domain, and scope exclusions.
- [x] Inspect the starting QMCPy-only prototype files.
- [x] Inspect relevant Quarto and deployment patterns in `MATH565Fall2026`.
- [x] Confirm the maintained documentation and GitHub destinations from
  `QMCSoftware`.

### Phase 1 — Prepare the repository

- [x] Replace the standalone `index.html` with Quarto source.
- [x] Add ignore rules for generated Quarto output.
- [x] Preserve the root `CNAME` during prototype setup.
- [x] Add repository purpose, local-render instructions, project guidance,
  roadmap, and status documentation.
- [x] Avoid unnecessary runtime dependencies; no `requirements.txt` is needed
  for the current non-executable content.

### Phase 2A — Establish the original site skeleton

- [x] Configure a Quarto website that renders to `_site/`.
- [x] Add Home, Blogs, News & Events, Community, Documentation, and GitHub
  navigation.
- [x] Add initial Home and About sources.
- [x] Create `blogs/`, `news/`, `community/`, `assets/`, `styles/`, and workflow
  structure.
- [x] Link Documentation to the existing MkDocs site and GitHub to the primary
  QMCSoftware repository.

### Phase 2B — Establish the visual foundation

- [x] Add a restrained initial color palette, typography, spacing, hero, and
  responsive button treatment.
- [x] Widen the standard content column to improve the use of desktop space
  while retaining readable prose line lengths.
- [x] Keep the styling local and independent of classroom-specific styles.
- [ ] Review the prototype with collaborators and align it with any approved
  QMCSoftware visual identity or assets.
- [ ] Complete browser-based responsive and accessibility review.

- [x] Replace the QMCPy-specific homepage with an organization-wide homepage.
- [x] Add a Software section for QMCPy, QMCToolsCL, QuasiMC.jl, and LDData.
- [x] Add a Publications prototype without inventing a complete bibliography.
- [x] Update shared navigation, metadata, footer, and organization-wide copy.
- [x] Keep each project's detailed documentation in its maintained repository.
- [x] Retain `qmcpy.org` and the existing `CNAME` during the initial transition.
- [x] Set `qmcsoftware.org` as the long-term canonical domain and custom domain.
- [ ] Verify any required redirects from the former domain.
- [ ] Approve an organization-level visual identity and navbar mark, if any.

### Phase 4 — Refine the homepage

- [x] Add a concise prototype introduction and primary documentation/GitHub
  actions.
- [x] Add clear pathways to learning, updates, and community information.
- [ ] Replace provisional wording only with collaborator-approved public copy.
- [x] Add recent QMCPy PyPI download activity as the first sourced impact
  highlight, while keeping the automatically generated repository report
  authoritative.
- [ ] Add other approved imagery, examples, or impact highlights if they
  provide clear value.

### Phase 5 — Migrate the blog

- [x] Migrate “Why Add Q to MC?” as the first self-contained Quarto post,
  preserving its authorship, mathematical explanation, equations, figures, and
  captions.
- [x] Revise “Why Add Q to MC?” as a living article with one last-revised date,
  qualified convergence claims, and practical guidance.
- [x] Migrate “A QMCPy Quick Start” as a self-contained Quarto post, preserving
  its original authorship, date, Keister example, code, mathematics, output,
  references, and figure.
- [x] Establish listing metadata and a discoverable Blogs index.
- [x] Inventory the existing 18 posts and their assets without modifying the
  source repository.
- [x] Define consistent Quarto post metadata, paths, authorship, and categories.
- [x] Use one `date` value per post as the last-revised date, label it “Last
  revised,” and sort the archive by that value without separate first-published
  metadata.
- [x] Convert the complete 18-post archive, including MkDocs snippets, callouts,
  image groups, internal links, and mathematical delimiters.
- [x] Preserve the original visible content of 17 posts and retain the approved
  living-article revisions to “Why Add Q to MC?”.
- [x] Verify last-revised dates, authors, local links, code, mathematics, and all
  48 images in a complete local render and browser review.
- [x] Add the two May 2026 QMCPy documentation blogs on iteration logs and
  resuming integrations, retaining links to their executable notebooks.
- [x] Expand the current website archive from the historic 18 posts to 20 posts.
- [ ] Define and verify redirects or canonical handling for legacy URLs.
- [ ] Publish the complete archive only after collaborator review.

### Phase 6 — Build news and events

- [x] Add the section entry page without invented announcements.
- [x] Add a sourced prototype news item and a discoverable News & Events
  listing.
- [ ] Define lightweight metadata and archive conventions.
