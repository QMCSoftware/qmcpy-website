# QMCSoftware Website Status

## Complete

- [x] Confirmed Quarto-on-`main`, `_site/`, `gh-pages`, and `qmcsoftware.org`
  architecture.
- [x] Replaced the standalone HTML landing page with one Quarto source site.
- [x] Converted the QMCPy-only prototype into an umbrella QMCSoftware site.
- [x] Added Software pages for QMCPy, QMCToolsCL, QuasiMC.jl, and LDData.
- [x] Added a Publications prototype and organization-wide navigation.
- [x] Migrated and revised “Why Add Q to MC?” as a living article, preserving
  its mathematical explanation, figures, captions, and authorship while adding
  qualified convergence and practical-use guidance.
- [x] Migrated “A QMCPy Quick Start,” preserving its original authorship, date,
  Keister example, equations, code, output, references, and figure.
- [x] Added a sourced 2026 SIAM Fellow news item.
- [x] Added a hand-written featured publication and a one-record YAML catalog
  convention for ordinary publications.
- [x] Documented the separation between the broad AcademicLib registry,
  website-curated publication records, and blog-local citations; catalog
  display order no longer depends on YAML record order.
- [x] Added working Blogs, News & Events, and Publications listings.
- [x] Preserved Home, About, Blogs, News & Events, and Community pages.
- [x] Added authoritative project documentation and repository links.
- [x] Added a restrained responsive visual foundation.
- [x] Widened the standard content column from 800 to 900 pixels for desktop
  pages while preserving responsive behavior.
- [x] Retained the QMCPy logo asset for possible project-specific use while
  removing it from organization-level branding.
- [x] Added GitHub Actions rendering and `gh-pages` publication with explicit
  `CNAME` preservation.
- [x] Set `qmcsoftware.org` as the canonical site URL and GitHub Pages custom
  domain.
- [x] Added repository guidance, roadmap, ignore rules, and local instructions.
- [x] Rendered the complete 13-page site and verified local link targets and
  rendered `CNAME` preservation.
- [x] Migrated the complete historic 18-post QMCPy blog archive into
  self-contained Quarto posts while retaining the technical documentation and
  notebooks in the QMCPy repository.
- [x] Added the two newer QMCPy documentation blogs, “Stop Re-running” and
  “How Much Accuracy Do You Need?”, bringing the current archive to 20 posts.
- [x] Standardized blog chronology on one last-revised `date` per post, with no
  separate first-publication field, and retained the approved revised version
  of “Why Add Q to MC?”.
- [x] Preserved all 48 historic blog images and added two result figures for
  the newer iteration-log article; expanded MkDocs code snippets, converted
  callouts and image groups, and normalized mathematical delimiters for Quarto.
- [x] Rendered all 33 site pages and completed local link, desktop, and mobile
  checks for the 20-post archive.
- [x] Widened the shared blog reading column modestly and made title metadata
  responsive so realistic author names and dates wrap without clipping.
- [x] Added a responsive, YAML-driven QMC Software Directory under Community,
  separate from the organization-owned projects in Software.
- [x] Added an extensible Courses using QMCSoftware section under Community,
  beginning with the Fall 2025 and Fall 2026 MATH 565 offerings.
- [x] Added durable repository guidance, a multi-machine author workflow, and
  a concise operational handoff for direct Website collaboration.
- [x] Added recent PyPI download activity to the QMCPy project page, sourced
  from QMCPy's authoritative automatically generated report and refreshed by
  the Website publication workflow.

## Underway

- [ ] Collaborator review of the information architecture, visual direction,
  and provisional homepage copy.
- [ ] Accessibility review beyond the completed desktop and mobile browser
  checks.
- [ ] Exercise the new coordination workflow during several real Website tasks
  and refine it only where experience shows a need.

## Next recommended task

See [notes/NEXT.md](notes/NEXT.md) for the immediate operational handoff.

## Decisions and scope boundaries

- Technical documentation stays with each software project.
- QMCPy's repository remains authoritative for PyPI statistics; the Website
  publishes a synchronized public summary on the QMCPy project page.
- The Website owns the broader community QMC software directory; the Software
  section remains limited to projects maintained by the QMCSoftware
  organization.
- The primary GitHub link targets the QMCSoftware organization; project pages
  link to their respective repositories and documentation.
- The site uses `qmcsoftware.org` as its canonical URL and custom domain;
  redirect behavior from the former domain still requires verification.
- The historic 18-post QMCPy blog archive is published on the Website; the two
  May 2026 posts are migrated in a review branch, with publication still
  approval-gated.
- Blog cards and title blocks use each post's last-revised date; the archive is
  sorted newest revision first and does not carry a separate first-published
  date.
- “Why Add Q to MC?” remains the approved living article; the other 17 posts
  preserve the visible content of their source articles.
- No Reveal.js project, speculative infrastructure, or Python dependency file
  is included.
- Generated `_site/` output remains outside the `main` branch.
- Small, validated Website changes may be published directly to `main`; use a
  short-lived branch when work spans sessions, overlaps another task, or
  benefits from isolation or review.
