# QMCSoftware website

This repository contains the public-facing website for
[QMCSoftware](https://github.com/QMCSoftware), built with
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/). It is an umbrella site for the organization's
software, publications, blogs, news and events, and community information.

Technical documentation remains with each software repository. The website
links to maintained project documentation instead of duplicating it.

The site uses `https://qmcsoftware.org` as its canonical URL and GitHub Pages
custom domain.

## Local preview

Install Quarto, then run:

```bash
quarto preview
```

To create the production output in `_site/`:

```bash
quarto render
```

The `main` branch is the source branch. GitHub Actions renders the site and
publishes `_site/` to `gh-pages`; generated output is not committed to `main`.
The same workflow refreshes the public QMCPy PyPI summary from QMCPy's
authoritative `pypi-stats` branch on every deployment and on a weekly schedule.

## Collaboration and handoff

Repository rules are documented in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), the multi-machine
authoring and publication process in
[AUTHOR_WORKFLOW.md](AUTHOR_WORKFLOW.md), and the immediate operational handoff
in [notes/NEXT.md](notes/NEXT.md). [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) records the durable
roadmap, while [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) records milestone progress and scope
decisions.
